## Program A - JSON

### Purpose of the Program:

This program has been created to take in one well-formed JSON from STDIN and returns STDOUT as a string. The three main cases are as follows: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Any dictionary keys are not returned  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) All non key integers are replaced with the string "number" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) All non key strings are returned without any manipulation <br>
The program can be run on command line with the prompt ./xjson followed by the JSON STDIN. <br>

### Tests:

A single test was created following the n-in.json and n-out.json method specified in the homework assignment directions <br>
(we assigned n to be 0). A n-in.json test can be fed into ./xjson by running ./xjson < Tests/n-in.json <br> <br>
The files can be found in the Tests folder. File path: stoic-whales/A/Tests. 

### Directory Organization:

NOT all files and folders are presented in this display.
The focus is on the location of the code, java jar, json library, and xjson.iml file.

## Program B - GUI

### Purpose of the Program:

This program takes in a well-formed and valid JSON STDIN input and outputs an image of all the specified tiles side by side. The image is then saved into the directory with the given file name and then prints the string "Done" once the image has been saved. After that visual que, the user is then able to enter in another well-formed and valid STDIN and another image will be created and saved (unless the same file name is given which then leads to the new image to replace the old one). <br>
The program can be run on command line with the prompt xvfb-run ./xjson followed by the JSON STDIN.

### Tests:

None

### Directory Organization:

NOT all files and folders are presented in this display.
The focus is on the location of the code, java jar, image folder, javaFX library, and pom.xml file.
<em> Due to using maven software with our javaFX GUI we needed to feed in the Jackson library in a pom.xml file </em>

## Program 2 - The Map

### Purpose of the Program At This Stage:

The Q-Game program that is heavily based off the well-known Qwirkle board game is currently in its earliest stage. The purpose of the current program is to present a data representation of the game map that supports 3 functionalities described on the assignment description. They are as follows: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)	Creating the map with a beginning tile (aka the refereeâ€™s tile) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2)	Extend the map with a different tile by placing it beside an already placed tile regardless of the color and shape <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3)	Determining all playable moves based on the game state based on a given tile

## Program C - TCP

### Purpose of the Program:

This program has been created to take in one well-formed JSON from STDIN sent in by the client and returns STDOUT as a string on the server side. The three main cases are as follows: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Any dictionary keys are not returned  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) All non key integers are replaced with the string "number" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) All non key strings are returned without any manipulation <br>
The program can be run on command line with the prompt ./xtcp followed by joining the localhost server and the the JSON STDIN. <br>

### Tests:

Three tests were created following the n-in.json and n-out.json method specified in the homework assignment directions. <br>
A n-in.json test can be fed into ./xtcp by running ./xtcp < Tests/n-in.json <br> <br>
The files can be found in the Tests folder. File path: stoic-whales/C/Tests. 

### Directory Organization:

## Milestone 5 - The Strategy

### Purpose of the Added Functionality Program At This Stage:
The purpose of the current program is to implement a strategy interface and two concrete variants:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The first one is called dag <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The second is called ldasg  <br>
The lexicographic ordering on tiles says that tile p is less than tile q if pâ€™s shape is less than qâ€™s. If pâ€™s shape is 
identical to qâ€™s, p is below q iff pâ€™s color is below qâ€™s. The order of the shapes and colors are: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shape: star < 8star < square < circle < clover < diamond <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color: red < green < blue < yellow > orange < purple <br>
We then equip the strategy component with an iteration functionality. Starting from some game state, the piece of 
functionality applies a given strategy as far as possible to obtain the longest possible series of placements or 
a replacement decision or a pass decision.

### Tests:
All JSON test specific to this phase of the project can be run using the jar file using ./xscore command.

All tests are located in the 5/Tests folder.

## Milestone 6 - The Game

### Purpose of the Added Functionality Program At This Stage:
The purpose of the current program is to create and implement the referee and players in the program: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The player should be able to pick a strategy to implement and  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referee should be able to communicate with the players and game state <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until the game is over. Then they announce the winner(s) and end the game. <br>
As the title implies this compelents the basic operations and comonents for the program to conduct a full game.

## Milestone 8 - The Observer

### Purpose of the Added Functionality Program At This Stage:
The purpose of the current program is to create an user interface that represents the game state at every phase of the game if an oberver exists.
Its two main features are: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. saving the states it receives as PNG files in a directory called Tmp/, naming each image the order in which it was created (ex: 0.png)  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. displays the states it receives as images in a GUI. This GUI supports the following three interaction capabilities:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 a next functionality shows the next state of the game, if it is available <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 a previous functionality shows the previous state of the game, if it is available <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3 a save functionality saves the current state as an instance of JState in a file of the userâ€™s choice.

## Milestone 9 - Remote

### Purpose of the Added Functionality Program At This Stage:
The purpose of the current program is to create the functionality that allows for third party players join the game server and play
through a game. Once the server is on, players are given 20 seconds to join (with 3 seconds to enter their names) and additional 20
seconds if less then two players join. If less then two players join the server will not start a game and will return the JSON STDIN 
"[[ ], [ ]]". If two or more players join, the game will starts and play out as expected. If players take to long to complete certain
tasks (6 seconds) during the game they will be removed as well. If there are any issues on the server side that disrupts or changes 
objects within the game, the server will terminate the game and shut down the server.
