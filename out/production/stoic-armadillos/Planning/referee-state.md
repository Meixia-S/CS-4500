            SUBJECT: The Referee State

The referee needs to "contact" the game state everytime the referee gets the user input. While it may not edit the map or the 
current player's score it will need to go to the next player and start a new round (if applicable). The two largest changes in 
the interface from the first time we designed it are: 
                  1) the functionality to keep track of each players turn (which three option they chose) 
                     to be able to determine if the game should be over
                  2) the functionality to keep track of each phase of the game state inorder to start the 
                     game at any given moment (that has already been played)

The referee-state class fields' are:
<table>     <tr>
                            <th>Name</th>
                            <th>Data Type</th>

### The Interaction Protocol Between the Referee and the Game-State Component 
<pre>
1) The referee set-ups the game state, order players and distribute the tiles to 
the players
2) The referee starts the game map with one referee's tile
3) Referee keep tracks of the order of players in this game state
Referee let the active player play their turn.
4) After requesting move from player the referee: 
    1. Validate: validates player' move
        If it is not valid the referee can kick player out of game and reorder the players 
    2. Place: if the move if valid, the referee places their tile on this game map
    3. Exchange: referee takes all 6 tiles from player and replaces them with 6 randomly selected tiles from the pile
        If the player requests an exchange when the pile is less then 6, this is considered a invalid move
    4. Pass: the referee simply moves on to the next player without any modifications to the player
    5. Score: determines the score for the move and add it to the players running score
5) the referee updates the game state after player's move
6) As long as the round is not over, the current state of the game is saved and 
the next player may start their turn
7) If the round is over, the referee checks if the game is over
    If it is, jump to step 9
8) 4 - 6 are repeated every round until the game is over 
9) When the game is over the referee announces the winner and the rankings of players
10) Game ends, all game state and player data is reset
